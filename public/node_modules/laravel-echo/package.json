When some data is updated on the server, a message is typically sent over a WebSocket connection to be handled by the client. This provides a more robust, efficient alternative to continually polling your application for changes.\n\nTo assist you in building these types of applications, Laravel makes it easy to \"broadcast\" your events over a WebSocket connection. Broadcasting your Laravel events allows you to share the same event names between your server-side code and your client-side JavaScript application.\n\nLaravel Echo is a JavaScript library that makes it painless to subscribe to channels and listen for events broadcast by Laravel. You may install Echo via the NPM package manager.\n\n## Documentation\n\nOfficial documentation [is located here](http://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).\n",
